      <span class="faq-btn">FAQ</span>
      <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">WHY SHOULD ANIMALS BE PROTECTED?</h2><br>
      <p>•	Animals are far more sensitive, conscious, and intelligent than humans have long thought, as science continues to show. Animals are probably aware of the mistreatment they endure in lab studies and the unfavorable conditions in which they are housed in factory farms, thus it is long overdue for policies to change. Additionally, animals are essential to the ecosystems and biospheres that support human life on Earth. Preserving animals and their natural habitats, such as grasslands, forests, and oceans, will contribute to the preservation of all living things, including humans.
      </p><br><br>
      <h2>DOES BAWP PROMOTE ANIMAL CONTROL?</h2><br>
      <p>•	Animal control deals with the stray animal population, complaints regarding pet waste and sanitation, and animals becoming a nuisance to the community or posing a risk to public health. We at BAWP promote animal welfare, wherein it refers to the well-being of animals. It aims to promote responsible pet ownership and put an end to animal cruelty.
      </p><br><br>
      <h2>IS THERE A POSSIBILITY FOR THE STRAYS UP FOR ADOPTION TO BE A CARRIER OF DISEASES?</h2><br>
      <p>•	Before we put up stray animals for adoption, we monitor and check up on their health status. We give them vaccinations and treat them if they are in urgent need.</p>
